# ARM Cortex-M
The ARM Cortex-M series of processor cores is designed for low-cost, energy-efficient microcontrollers. The STM32 family utilizes several variants of the Cortex-M cores.

The STM32 family encompasses a wide range of microcontrollers, categorized into different series, each targeting specific applications
We used STM32CubeMX for configuration and initialization code generation for STM32F103C8T6 model.
